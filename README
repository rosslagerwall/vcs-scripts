git-null
========

What is it?
-----------

git-null clears a Git working directory (or in Mercurial parlance, updates it
to the null revision).

This may be useful if you keep up-to-date with many (possibly large) Git
repositories and don't want to have thousands of files on disk while you're
not actively working on the project.

Usage
-----

Simply put git-null somewhere on your PATH and run it in the root of a Git
repository.

$ cd ~/src/git-repo
$ git-null

Contributing
------------

Fork it on GitHub, hack away and then send a pull request.
