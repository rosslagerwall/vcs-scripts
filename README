vcs-scripts
===========

What is it?
-----------

A set of VCS (version control system) scripts to supplement the functionality
of the existing systems.


svn-null and git-null clear the working directory (or in Mercurial parlance,
updates it to the null revision).

This may be useful if you keep up-to-date with many (possibly large)
repositories and don't want to have thousands of files on disk while you're not
actively working on the project.


svn-clean removes unversioned and ignored files from the working copy.

Usage
-----

Simply put the scripts somewhere on your PATH. Then run as follows:

$ cd ~/src/git-repo
$ git-null

If git is run with an unknown command, it searches for that command in your PATH
so, running:
$ git null
will run git-null if it is in your PATH.

$ cd ~/src/svn-repo

Clean the repo of all unversioned and ignored files:
$ svn-clean -f

Clear the repo of all files:
$ svn-null
